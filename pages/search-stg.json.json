            "content": "<p><span class=\"highlighters\">So, who is my neighbor?</span></p>\n<p>Remember the golden rule? Treat others the way you would like to be treated? Well, Jesus had a version of that: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” He wasn’t the first one to say it — it was written into Jewish law — but he confirmed that it was one of the most important things for us to do, one of the major keys to a fulfilled life. So, who is my neighbor?</p>\n<p>Jesus was asked that exact question, and his answer made some things pretty clear. He told a story: A man is walking down a road when he is jumped by some robbers and beaten within an inch of his life. A little later on, a priest walking down the road — a priest of the dying man’s same ethnicity and religion — sees him lying there and walks right past him. Sometime later, another holy man with a similar background walks right past the dying man as well. Finally, a Samaritan man — a complete stranger from a culture that was a historic enemy to the Jewish people — walks up and bandages the man’s wounds, puts him on his own personal donkey, and takes him to an inn where he pays out of pocket for him to stay and be healed.</p>\n<p>Jesus was asked about neighbors and answered with a story of travelers. Why? Because your neighbors are not just the people you live and spend your time with. Your neighbor is anyone you interact with. Whether you know them, like them, look like them, or not, they’re your neighbor. Jews and Samaritans often hated each other. They had a long history of bad blood. Jesus was painting a picture of total opposites.<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1853 size-full\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"910\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote2.png 950w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote2-300x287.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote2-517x495.png 517w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote2-768x736.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /><br />\nHave you ever been to the airport and sat down across from someone you’re certain would disagree with you on every one of your fundamental beliefs? You can just tell by the way they dress, the book they’re reading, the food they brought to the gate — your view of the world and theirs must be irreconcilable. Are you picturing that person in your mind? Great. That’s your neighbor. And so is the man asking for change at the red light. And the family member who is estranged. And the person you’re hoping doesn’t move in next door. They’re all your neighbors.</p>\n<p>So then, the second part of the equation is figuring out what it means to love all those neighbors as yourself. This is where it gets hard. In the story he told, to love our neighbors requires altering our plans and path to be kind to people without ever expecting anything in return. The way Jesus talked about it, loving your neighbor is wholly inconvenient, wildly selfless, and nearly impossible to do well all the time.<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1855 size-full\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote3.png 1200w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote3-300x200.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote3-743x495.png 743w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote3-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><br />\nBut Jesus didn’t seem to care about us doing it perfectly. His teachings suggest that he wanted us to consider our intentions and do the work to act from a place of empathy. Eventually, loving our neighbors is an action that can become intuitive. So, how do we do that? There are three simple steps that can help. When Jesus told that story and mentioned that a Samaritan man was walking down the road, the crowd would’ve tensed up. Many hated Samaritans. But Jesus shockingly made the Samaritan the hero, perhaps showing the first step in being a good neighbor is to avoid judging others. Jesus didn’t teach hate or assume the worst.<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1854 size-full\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote4.png 1200w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote4-300x200.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote4-743x495.png 743w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LovingYourNeighbor_Quote4-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><br />\nAnother clue is in the word “neighbor.” In Greek, the language in which this story was written, this word is “plesion,” which just means “near.” The Samaritan man whom Jesus sets up as the model good neighbor? He approaches the dying man. He gets close. The other two walk past on the other side of the road. So, step two is to practice drawing near to people we would otherwise avoid. To strike up a conversation. To listen to their perspective.</p>\n<p>Imagine for a moment if the people pictured in the video did exactly that — listened to one another as a neighbor. They might not come to agreement, but they certainly would become better neighbors — by getting close and listening.</p>\n<p>And the final clue is in how the Samaritan man puts everything on hold to care for the dying man. It’s an extreme example, but at its core, the man is putting the needs of another above his own. Step three is to choose humility. To put yourself in the other person’s shoes and to attend to their needs like you would take care of your own. Jesus modeled this by washing his disciples’ feet — the teacher humbling himself before his students. Jesus wasn’t blinded by quick judgments, and neither was the Samaritan. They both got close and then put their neighbor’s needs above their own. They loved their neighbors. What would it look like if we all made an effort to love ours?</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>As we thought about what to do for this year’s commercial, we reflected on our 2023 TV spot, “Love Your Enemies.” That commercial was all about Hate and Division. Ultimately, it was about pride. Pride says, “I’m right, and you’re wrong.” Every image depicted people in a state of prideful contention, whether it be politicians yelling in a debate or parents fighting at a youth football game.</p>\n<p>So we thought that maybe this year, we should focus on the thematic inverse of last year’s commercial — one built on the premise of Love and Unity. And with an upcoming election year that will be filled with division and derision, we decided to focus on one of the most important directives given by Jesus — Love Your Neighbor.<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1857 size-full\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote2.png 1000w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote2-300x200.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote2-742x495.png 742w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote2-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><br />\nAs we explored creative ideas, we recalled the story of Jesus washing his disciples’ feet and realized this was the perfect example of how we should treat one another, even those people with whom we don’t see eye to eye. Jesus had washed Peter’s feet, a loyal friend who would publicly deny that he knew Jesus later that very night. And even more astoundingly, Jesus washed Judas Iscariot’s feet, the one who would betray him for 30 pieces of silver.<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1858 size-full\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote1.png 1000w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote1-300x200.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote1-742x495.png 742w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote1-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><br />\nSo why did Jesus wash the feet of both friends and foes? What was he teaching them then and us today?</p>\n<p>In ancient times, many travelers traveled by foot in sandals or even barefoot. The dusty roads and rocky trails left their feet coated with grime or caked with mud. Upon arrival at their destination, a host would often bring a basin of water to wash the weary travelers’ feet. It was a gesture of welcome and kindness, not to mention a practical means to keep dirt out of the home. And in the homes of the wealthy or powerful, it was most likely done by a servant, a slave, or the wife of the host.</p>\n<p>But Jesus took it one step further. During his last meal with his closest followers, the 12 disciples, Jesus retrieved a bowl, filled it with water, and began washing their feet with a rag. But this wasn’t a traditional cleaning after a road trip. Jesus was using foot washing to emphasize a larger point — a symbol for all of his followers to see how they should treat one another.<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1856\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"917\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote3.png 1000w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote3-300x275.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote3-540x495.png 540w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote3-768x704.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><br />\nThe disciples considered Jesus not only to be their master or religious leader but also, most even revered him as the promised Messiah — a long-awaited king who would, according to their prophecy, deliver Israel from its oppressors, in this time period, the Romans. When Jesus offered to wash his disciples’ feet, it was so antithetical to their way of thinking that some initially declined his offer. But Jesus explained, “Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you should wash one another’s feet.” John 13:14. Not only was Jesus teaching them that a true leader should be willing to humble himself or herself and serve all, but also that they should be willing to wash one another’s feet. Foot washing required humility on the part of both parties: the one willing to wash another’s feet and also the one willing to have their feet washed. It was an act of mutual admiration. Jesus was shedding any notion of rank or caste among his disciples.</p>\n<p>Foot washing requires one to lower themselves, even kneel before another person. While the posture seems subservient at first, it truly represents an act of kindness and generosity that makes the actions of the foot washer noble. That was always the way of Jesus — put others first and himself last. He had previously taught, “The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.” Matthew 23:11-12. He was now putting that very teaching into practice.<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1859\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"917\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote4.png 1000w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote4-300x275.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote4-540x495.png 540w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FootWashing_Quote4-768x704.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><br />\nIt was these words and actions of Jesus that inspired us. We began to imagine a world where ideological others were willing to set their differences aside and wash one another’s feet. How would that look? How would our contentious world change if we washed one another’s feet, not literally, but figuratively? Figurative foot washing can be as simple as giving a compliment to a co-worker or paying for a stranger’s lunch. It can also be as difficult as not responding to someone who’s criticizing you or reaching out to an estranged family member. Acts of kindness done out of humility and respect for another person could be considered the equivalent of foot washing.</p>\n<p>Honestly, images of people washing each other’s feet look a little strange and disconcerting because it’s not part of our modern-day customs. But there’s also something beautiful and profound in each image. Our hope is that our latest commercials will stimulate both societal discussion and individual self-reflection about “who is my neighbor?” and how each of us can love our neighbor even as we have differences and serve one another with more kindness and respect.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>With two spots in this year’s biggest professional football game, we wanted to ensure that our 15-second commercial, “Who Is My Neighbor,” built on the concept presented in the 60-second commercial, “Foot Washing.” We felt that if we were going to encourage others to love their neighbors, then we should provide some insight into whom that word includes, and while there are some surface-level observations as to who those people might be, we thought it would be best to explore how Jesus defined neighbors through his actions.</p>\n<p>His belief was simple and unfiltered — everyone is a neighbor. Everyone in every sense of the word, not just the people in our orbit whom we have something in common with but also the ones we don’t notice, the people we don’t value, and those we don’t welcome. Admittedly, noticing people who aren’t loved ones or a part of our day-to-day life isn’t always top of mind. In a world that often feels more digital than tangible, it’s no secret that our ability to connect with each other is duller than it used to be. Not to mention, our attention at any given moment is being pulled into what feels like infinite directions.<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1851 size-full\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote1-e1707657428919.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"610\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote1-e1707657428919.png 1200w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote1-e1707657428919-300x153.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote1-e1707657428919-974x495.png 974w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote1-e1707657428919-768x390.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><br />\nIn a very different way, Jesus faced similar challenges. Sure, he didn’t have the distraction of a smartphone, but he was a popular guy who drew crowds. People sought his attention, yet he took time to give his to those who never got any. He noticed ill-stricken people with leprosy and comforted them. These were people who were ignored by everyone else, yet he displayed neighborly love toward them. We thought about the people we don’t notice in our own lives walking down the street, in the aisle at the grocery store, or even those living next door to us. Jesus’ example served as a simple yet powerful reminder that he put the “every” in everyone, so we wanted to create work that did the same.<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1850 size-full\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"917\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote3.png 1000w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote3-300x275.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote3-540x495.png 540w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote3-768x704.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><br />\nJesus often led by example. In doing so, he led us to another type of neighbor — the ones we don’t value. During his time, women were relegated to subservient roles in a male-dominated society, but Jesus didn’t bend to the status quo. He spoke to women in public, which was a social taboo. He stood up for women during moments of injustice and involved them in ministry to boot. He valued women beyond their traditional roles and treated them kindly and equally. In our world, it’s easy to value those who share the same values as us or those who belong to the same groups, but we were inspired by Jesus’ willingness to defy that trend.</p>\n<p>The third type of neighbor seemed to jump out at us after we examined Jesus’ life. We noticed that Jesus was inclined to welcome others. His trusted disciples were complete strangers when he met them, yet he welcomed them into his life and built his platform alongside them. He could’ve turned to family or others that he knew from his youth, but his prerogative was to find neighbors who were vastly different from him and one another to bring together. He was profoundly and deliberately backward in that way.<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1852 size-full\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote2.png 1200w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote2-300x200.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote2-743x495.png 743w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WIMN_Quote2-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><br />\nWe found these examples compelling and wanted to craft an ad that reflected what the unnoticed, the undervalued, and the unwelcomed might look like today in our own lives. Once we saw the images, the idea that everyone is a neighbor resonated even deeper with us. We saw each of these people as part of a whole. People we should offer compassion to because if they flourish, we all do. Each one of us is a part of one larger community. Jesus knew that all too well. It’s why he wanted us to use our differences as a catalyst for conversations that can lead us to invite each other in rather than keeping one another at bay.</p>\n",

We researched how people feel about each other and what they think about Jesus and Christianity. We’ve connected with thousands of people of various faith traditions and those who claim no religion. We spoke to all kinds of people — different backgrounds, beliefs, and, yes, political affiliations. And this is what we’ve learned: From politics to sexuality and religion, so many of us feel like our values, beliefs, and identities are under attack by the ideological “others” around us. Many perceive those who differ with them on issues of justice, dignity, and humanity as not just wrong or misguided but also as evil. As enemies. We often see these “others” as close-minded, selfish, hypocritical — and if we’re honest, many of us respond in kind. </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-638 size-full\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"725\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-3.png 1800w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-3-300x121.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-3-1200x483.png 1200w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-3-768x309.png 768w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-3-1536x619.png 1536w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-3-1400x564.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more ideologically defensive we become, the more we are willing to sacrifice things like kindness, patience, and the respect and dignity of others for the sake of victory — the righteous ends justifying the dehumanizing means.

And though some no longer believe in God, most are still compelled by the idea of a person capable of unconditional love for others despite their differences. But many of us simply cannot reconcile the idea of that person with the way our culture experiences religion today. Whether it’s hypocrisy and discrimination in the church, or scandals both real and perceived among religious leaders, or the polarization of our politics, many have relegated Jesus from the world’s greatest love story to just another tactic used to intensify our deep cultural divisions. </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-639 size-full\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-2-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-2-3.png 1800w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-2-3-300x200.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-2-3-743x495.png 743w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-2-3-768x512.png 768w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-2-3-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-2-3-600x400.png 600w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-2-3-1200x800.png 1200w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-2-3-1400x933.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did we get here?

Our work represents the input from Christians who believe that Jesus is the son of God as well as many others who, though not Christians, share a deep admiration for the man that Jesus was, and we are deeply inspired and curious to explore his story. We look at the biography of Jesus through a modern lens to find new relevance in often overlooked moments and themes from his life. If you’d like to join us, you’re invited. Below you’ll find several resources to explore the story of Jesus for yourself. </span></p>\n",

ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney—these tools have all made quite the splash. Some of us have adopted them with open arms looking for ways to make things more efficient, some of us have kept them at an arm’s length, weary of the ethicality of it all.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-885\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-9.png 1800w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-9-300x125.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-9-1188x495.png 1188w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-9-768x320.png 768w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-9-1536x640.png 1536w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-9-1200x500.png 1200w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Quote-1-9-1400x583.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" /></p>\n<p>We’re personally still trying to make sense of where AI fits and how it can and should be used, but we figured we’d try to take some cues from Jesus. It struck us, Jesus used the tools available to him in redemptive ways. Roman roads were built by occupiers to move armies—Jesus used them to travel far and wide sharing his message. A simple boat built for fishing—Jesus used it as a platform from which to speak. Twelve ragtag, ordinary people with messy pasts—Jesus placed them at the center of the work he was doing. Jesus was less interested in what the world said about a person or thing and more about how it could show the kind of love he was interested in. So this video was our attempt to do the same. Whether AI is messy, confusing, harmless, or not, how could we use it to talk about the kind of love Jesus talked about?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-881\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveHeadlines-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3750\" height=\"261\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveHeadlines-02.png 3750w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveHeadlines-02-300x21.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveHeadlines-02-1200x84.png 1200w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveHeadlines-02-768x53.png 768w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveHeadlines-02-1536x107.png 1536w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveHeadlines-02-2048x143.png 2048w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveHeadlines-02-1400x97.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3750px) 100vw, 3750px\" /></p>\n<p>We started by asking an artificial intelligence image generator to show us pictures of “love.” Just a one-word prompt. The results were very abstract, flowery, and fake. At first, we were disappointed in the AI, but then we realized the AI is trained on real images out in the real world — if the AI’s depiction of love feels fake, it’s because fake love is what we’ve shown it. So, we regrouped and tried something else. We gave the AI text prompts that were simply Jesus’ own words describing love. We were floored by the results. Not because they’re perfect—some of the images are admittedly haunting, others a bit surreal, but they are all reflective of a deeper, more real love than what we got out of the AI before—a love that is active, selfless, and difficult.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-882\" src=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveQuote2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3750\" height=\"1985\" srcset=\"https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveQuote2.png 3750w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveQuote2-300x159.png 300w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveQuote2-935x495.png 935w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveQuote2-768x407.png 768w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveQuote2-1536x813.png 1536w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveQuote2-2048x1084.png 2048w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveQuote2-1200x635.png 1200w, https://content.hegetsus.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AILoveQuote2-1400x741.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3750px) 100vw, 3750px\" /></p>\n<p>You see Jesus didn’t just love his friends and family. He loved the sick, the poor, the people he knew wouldn’t love him back, he even loved the people who tortured and killed him. He loved them all at their best and at their worst. That kind of love is complex and hard to fathom, impossible to fully capture in 1 picture or 1000, but still he lived it out.</p>\n<p>We’re still not sure what to think of all this new AI stuff, but for us, visualizing Jesus’ love in comparison to the commercialized, fluffy, romantic love we’re inundated with was a confirmation that what Jesus spoke about and lived out is worth emulating.</p>\n<p>*All the images shown were created using Midjourney. All text prompts shown are the real text prompts used for each corresponding image.</p>\n",

Many of his most frequently quoted messages and standout stories happened while sharing a meal with others. As we looked closer, we noticed that his company around the table was a remarkably diverse cast. He shared meals with outcasts. He spent time with the self-righteous religious elite. He cared for people who had broken every rule and were seen as unclean. He dined at the tables of the wealthy men whose riches were won with lies and corruption. Some of those men gave up comfortable lifestyles to follow him. He crossed racial boundaries to the shock of many around him. He invited everyone to the table. When asked why he did so, he replied, “… I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was radical at the time. No one was that inclusive. The religious do-gooders began to whisper behind his back. They called him a friend of sinners. It was supposed to be an insult, but Jesus wore it proudly. He was a friend to everyone. And what do friends do? They eat dinner together and share in each other’s lives.</p>\n<p>Strangers eating together and becoming friends. What a simple concept, and yet, we’re pretty sure it would turn our own modern world upside down the same way Jesus turned his around 2,000 years ago. That’s really why we made this video in the first place. We see division and broken relationships everywhere. We see judgment and hypocrisy on the rise. We see people who claim to be followers of Jesus taking his open invite and turning it into an exclusive club.</p>\n<p>The name of Jesus has been used to harm and divide, but if you look at how he lived, you see how backward that really is. Jesus was not exclusive. He was radically inclusive. What would our world look like if that were the norm? If strangers became friends over the dinner table as they did around Jesus?</p>\n",

While there, he had an incredibly important conversation with a woman who never would have expected to speak with him because he was Jewish, because he was a man, and because she was a bit of an outcast. The woman was totally caught off guard. To her, Jesus was a man who was breaking all sorts of boundaries to talk to her. To him, it seems she was worthy of so much more respect and kindness than anyone ever showed her. It might not seem like much, but this unlikely conversation set the stage for Jesus to live out and share his message of radical love and selflessness and to invite the most unlikely of people to play a part in it all.</p>\n",

                        "content": "<p>When it comes to family, there’s an interesting continuity that nestles itself into every family dynamic on the planet, no matter the cultural background — at some point and on some level, they’re going to be dysfunctional. Of course, the degree of dysfunctionality varies, but it’s always there, rearing its head around the holiday dinner table and even at larger gatherings like weddings or reunions.</p>\n<p>What boggles the mind even further is the fact that this dysfunctionality has always been present throughout the course of our history on this planet, and nobody is exempt from it, not even Jesus. He had a family who loved him but also attempted to undermine him. There is a moment in the Scriptures where Jesus was speaking to a large crowd, making claims that probably made his family uncomfortable. Be it the scale of his ministry or the direction of it, his family did not approve. Once they caught wind of what he was saying to the crowd, they tried to quiet him and pull him away from the crowd by asserting that he had lost his mind. Jesus responded by declaring that his purpose and devotion to God came before his family.</p>\n<p>Imagine being so passionate about your ideas that you want to share them with others, only to have your family shoot them down and call you crazy in a public setting for hundreds to see. Perhaps you don’t have to imagine because you know what it feels like when family doesn’t believe in your direction in life or attempts to cut your dreams down at the ankles. Ring any bells? Unfortunately, family dysfunction is something most of us know a little too well, or at least more than we’d care to admit.</p>\n<p>This was a singular instance, but Jesus behaved boldly and held radical ideas, and it’s likely that he had other moments of contention with his immediate family because of this, but there’s another consideration to keep in mind — his lineage. If you look at the genealogy of Jesus, you’ll see he came from a mixed bag. His oldest known relative, Abraham, was a peaceful immigrant who set forth on a dangerous journey to establish a new nation. Noble, right?</p>\n<p>Sure, but one of his great-grandmothers disguised herself as a sex worker and tricked her father-in-law into impregnating her. He also had a great-grandfather who abused his power as king to send a man into battle to be killed because he lusted after his wife. There are words to describe their character, too, but noble doesn’t quite come to mind. It is likely that the stories of Jesus’ ancestors were shared with him, and he was well aware of the checkered background from which he came.</p>\n<p>Maybe Jesus had such a large capacity for grace for other people because he came from a dysfunctional family, too. One that doubted him, dismissed him, and had reason to cause him shame, but he didn’t resent them for it. We can’t choose our families, but like Jesus, we can choose to stand firm in our purpose and lead with love. No matter how messy your family situation is, know that you aren’t alone, and you, too, can find healthy ways to deal with the mud.</p>\n",

If you listen to the news, you hear louder voices, stronger opinions, and harsher disagreements. If you scroll through your social feeds, you see arguments in the comment section of the most benign posts. Everyone wants to be heard, and collectively, we seem to be going to greater and greater lengths to be the one voice loud enough to be made out above the din.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1011\" src=\"https://newstaging2stg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/LovedLouderQuote1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3750\" height=\"2400\" />But as we listened, we noticed that most of what gets amplified — most of the stuff loud enough to be heard — is rife with hate, anger, and discontentment. And when hate gets amplified, too often, we try to drown it out with even louder hate from a different perspective. It’s a vicious cycle, and it’s one Jesus dealt with 2,000 years ago.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1112\" src=\"https://newstaging2stg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/LovedLouderQuote-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"750\" />Everywhere he went, he was met with dissenting opinions, trap questions, and directed hatred. People were constantly trying to silence him, discredit him, or hijack his platform to amplify their own voices. It must have been infuriating, but he didn’t give in and add to the noise. Jesus used his voice, but he didn’t shout. He not only stayed on the path of preaching patience, selflessness, and love but more importantly, he also demonstrated them. He responded to the ever-increasing volume of hate with quiet and deliberate acts of love. And the result is evident in the fact that we’re still talking about it 2,000 years later: his love was louder, and it still is.</p>\n",

                        "title": "Four ways Jesus supported women’s equality.",
                        "content": "<p>We’ve created a lot of ads and messages about Jesus and women’s equality. Mostly because research has uncovered a lot of misconceptions out there regarding Jesus and how he thought about and treated women. It seems some cultural and religious traditions and norms have been conflated with the actual story of Jesus from the Bible (the most comprehensive record of Jesus’ life we have). So let’s explore four ways Jesus promoted women’s equality.</p>\n<p><b>1.) GENEALOGY. Before he was even born. </b></p>\n<p>The Gospels are four different accounts of Jesus’ life written by four of his followers. The first one that appears in most Bibles is written by Matthew. He starts his story the same way many biographical books began back then — by tracing Jesus’ genealogy.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever read the Bible or other ancient Near Eastern texts, you’ll see this pattern of tracing family trees: “so-and-so begat so-and-so, who begat so-and-so, etc.” We often skip these dry and boring sections of the text. But the genealogies in the Bible and similar ancient texts were less about historical records and more about proving a point about a person’s heritage or their claims to royalty or fortune.</p>\n<p>Matthew includes a few clues in the genealogy that help us understand how Jesus thought about gender equality. He includes five women. That would have been very strange for the time. Stranger still are the women he chose to include as Jesus’ ancestors.</p>\n<p>Tamar: A woman who pretended to be a sex worker to trick her father-in-law into getting her pregnant so she could keep her place in the family after her husband died. We know, it’s a crazy story. But it was really important in their culture at the time that she received justice according to their law. And justice for her was to have a family if she so desired. In fact, her father-in-law, upon realizing what happened, called her “more righteous than I.”</p>\n<p>Rahab: A sex worker/brothel owner who hid spies from Israel and helped them gather intelligence on the defenses of her city, so they could be successful in conquering it.</p>\n<p>Ruth: A widow whose love and loyalty were so confounding, she chose not to pursue the certainty of well-being she could have had by going back to her childhood family home after the death of her husband. Instead, she followed her mother-in-law to a strange land and married a close relative of her husband’s family to secure their welfare (again, it was culturally necessary at the time to ensure survival).</p>\n<p>Bathsheba: A woman who was raped by the king. He saw her bathing and decided he wanted her. So he sent her husband to the front of a bloody war where he was all but guaranteed to die (he did), so he could rationalize his forcing himself on her. She became the king’s wife and experienced the loss of an infant child.</p>\n<p>Mary: An unwed teen mom who, according to the law at the time, could have been stoned to death in the streets. She would no doubt have been gossiped about and ridiculed.</p>\n<p>Of the dozens of women mentioned in Hebrew Scriptures, why were these five women chosen? Is it because they had to do desperate things to survive? Is it because each of them demonstrates different aspects of the plight of gender inequality in most cultures? Is it because they persevered in spite of seemingly impossible circumstances? We don’t know. But the story is certainly trying to tell us something about how we think about and judge women and the role they played in shaping Jesus’ identity.</p>\n<p><b>2.) TALKING. Talking to women you didn’t know was a no-no.</b></p>\n<p>He didn’t care. Jesus addressed women directly and publicly, something that was culturally confounding at the time. It even confused his own followers and closest friends. And he seemed to do it all the time with all kinds of women. Foreigners, enemies, widows, and sex workers, and in every recorded case, he connected with them personally with kindness and grace. In one often-cited case, he spoke to (1.) a Samaritan who was (2.) a woman and who was (3.) collecting water at a well in the heat of the day. Those three details tell us how culturally inappropriate it would have been for him to initiate a conversation. Samaritans were considered almost subhuman by most Jewish people at the time because of their racial impurity. Unknown women were never spoken to because they were traditionally considered property to the men in their lives. And if she’s collecting water by herself in the middle of the day, it likely means she was an outcast even among her own people, as women would generally collect water in the morning to stay cool and together to stay safe. We find out later she was likely an outcast because she’d been with so many men. But Jesus didn’t just speak to her; he asked her for a drink of water! To take water from her, from a vessel that she touched, and to drink it would have been unthinkable. But it demonstrated to his followers and all who heard the story that his movement would require people to think differently.</p>\n<p><b>3.) EQUALITY. Jesus didn’t tolerate double standards.</b></p>\n<p>During his ministry, some men brought a woman before Jesus. They accused her of adultery and then quoted the laws that said she should be killed. He successfully defended a woman from being executed publicly for committing adultery. They were looking for Jesus to condemn her as well. But he didn’t. You see, adultery is one of those things that requires two participants. But they didn’t bring the man caught in adultery before Jesus, just the woman. The whole situation reeked of hypocrisy, and Jesus had very little patience for hypocritical men when it came to sexual infractions of his day. So, he stepped in and protected the woman. He wouldn’t stand for the double standards.</p>\n<p><b>4.) FOLLOWERS. Some of his first and most important followers were women.</b></p>\n<p>Mary Magdalene is mentioned in the stories of Jesus more often than just about any other follower, including the other men in his inner circle known as the apostles. She is a central figure in just about every significant moment in his story.</p>\n<p>Mary the sister of Martha (a different Mary than Mary Magdalene) is depicted sitting at Jesus’ feet listening to his teachings. While that might seem very insignificant, that posture is reserved for disciples listening to their Rabbis. In that time, Rabbis didn’t take on women as disciples. It just didn’t happen. Jesus didn’t just allow it, he encouraged it.</p>\n<p>Joanna was another loyal follower. She was married to a wealthy official named Chuza, whom the Bible identifies as a critical member of the government that would eventually have Jesus delivered to the occupying Roman forces for execution. Joanna and other wealthy women bankrolled Jesus’ mission. That’s right. Jesus’ love movement was funded by women.</p>\n<p>Though some have tried to minimize their critical role in the creation of Jesus’ radical love movement, there’s no question women were essential.</p>\n",

                        "content": "<p>In Jesus’ time, communities were deeply divided by bitter differences in religious beliefs, political positions, income inequality, legal status, and ethnic differences. Sound familiar?</p>\n<p>Jesus lived in the middle of a culture war, too. And though the political systems were different (not exactly a representative democracy), the greed, hypocrisy, and oppression different groups used to get their way were very similar.</p>\n<p>Let’s set the scene.</p>\n<p>Jesus was born at the height of the Roman Empire’s power. They’d conquered most of the known world, and Israel was no exception. Unlike previous empires that would try to destroy cultures by displacing conquered peoples’ leaders, the Romans didn’t force people to change their religion or customs as long as they kept their obligations to the empire. Rome would install a client king (a puppet government) and exact tribute (cash) in lots of different ways. Families were charged taxes per person—farmers on crops, fishermen on catches, and travelers were charged fees to use the roads. This was in addition to local business and religious taxes charged by priests.</p>\n<p>In Israel, political and religious factions were one and the same. Back then, it was Pharisees and Sadducees. Today, we have conservatives and liberals.</p>\n<p>The Pharisees were the most religiously conservative leaders. They had the most influence among the common working poor, who were the majority. They believed that a king would come one day to conquer Rome with violence and free their nation. Some preyed upon a mostly illiterate population by adding extra rules and requirements that were designed to force the working poor into a posture of subjugation.</p>\n<p>The Sadducees were wealthy aristocrats who had a vested financial interest in Roman rule. They were in charge of the temple, and they didn’t believe any savior king was coming. They made themselves wealthy by exacting unfair taxes and fees from the labor of their own people and by contriving money-making schemes that forced the poor to pay exorbitant prices to participate in temple sacrifice—a critical part of their religion.</p>\n<p>There were Zealot groups who hid in the hills and violently resisted Roman occupation, and then there were the Samaritans, often oppressed and marginalized because of their racial and ethnic identities.</p>\n<p>And so, the common farmer, fisherman, or craftsman’s family lived through a highly volatile political period. Overbearing religious leaders who despised and oppressed them, wealthy elites who ripped them off, racial and ethnic tension with neighbors, and sporadic violent outbreaks between an oppressive occupying army.</p>\n<p>So where was Jesus in all of this? Did he align with the religious elites? With the wealthy and powerful? Or did he start an uprising to overthrow them?</p>\n<p>None of the above.</p>\n<p>He went from town to town, offering hope, new life, and modeling a different way to live and to change the world. Instead of pursuing power, money, or religious authority, he shared a loving and sacrificially generous way of living. He chose not to go along with the schemes others used to impact the world. Instead, he championed a better way.</p>\n<p>And so, each of these political groups saw him as a threat. The Pharisees recognized his movement as an affront to their authority—exposing the hypocrisy of their practices. The Sadducees saw Jesus as a threat to their power and wealth because he exposed their money-making schemes. The Zealots violently rejected one of the essential themes of Jesus’ movement: love your enemy.</p>\n<p>In the end, it took all three of these groups to have him killed. A Zealot (Judas) betrayed his location to those seeking to arrest him, the Sadducees brought him before the Romans to be executed, and when the Romans couldn’t find a crime committed, the Pharisees rallied the people to force Rome’s hand.</p>\n<p>Isn’t it funny how political foes can come together to destroy a common enemy that threatens their designs? But in spite of their best efforts, his execution was only the beginning of a movement that continues to impact the world thousands of years later. Jesus’ movement was so impactful because he actively resisted and rejected participating in culture-war politics.</p>\n",

And never mind having dealings across the ethnic and political barriers that existed then. That, too, was a no-no.</p>\n<p>Yet, Jesus—who, as a religious Jewish teacher, had these expectations tenfold—didn’t follow any of these rules. In fact, he went out of his way to break them.</p>\n<p>Though there are still places today where women, ethnicities, and people with disabilities are openly excluded from society, it may be hard to fully understand how shocking Jesus’ behavior was when, for instance, he comforted a woman because she suffered from years of constant blood flow — a disorder that was considered unclean. Or when, without hesitation, he associated himself with a man sick with leprosy, and another with blindness, and yet another who was paralyzed. Or how about when he engaged in a deep conversation in broad daylight with a woman who came from a people that many likened to dogs, and then went on to visit a Roman man’s home to tend to the sick there.</p>\n<p>Jesus sought to include everyone in his ministry, giving them a place to belong by treating all with value and respect. This meant he crossed the line countless times. One of the more notable instances happened when he befriended a woman who was widely considered to be demon-possessed. Even today, we can imagine how this might’ve gotten tongues wagging. But because of Jesus’ compassion, this woman would go on to find her health and become one of the most influential people associated with him. Her name was Mary Magdalene, and the fact that we know about her over two-thousand years later is a testament to the barriers Jesus successfully erased by simply ignoring them.</p>\n<p>Today, Jesus’ legacy continues to challenge us to be inclusive in a real way, to reach past people’s physical and mental struggles, gender, and ethnicity so that we may really see them. And once we do, we might just find—much like those who knew Mary Magdalene in her time—that the people who are considered the least of us will impact us the most.</p>\n",

Their initial reactions were based on their bank account balances or the size of their homes, but upon further reflection, most of them began to recognize that they were rich in other ways –– a wealth that comes from within. Could Jesus, a man with few material possessions, be considered rich?

                        "content": "<p>We were thinking about what Jesus’ relationships with friends and family might have looked like and were surprised by what we found. Pastel paintings and imagery of Jesus so often depict him having a peaceful, wonderful time with his loved ones, but a closer look at the text paints a more complex picture.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-873\" src=\"https://newstaging2stg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RelationshipsHeadlines-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3750\" height=\"261\" />Shortly after beginning his public ministry, Jesus went back to his hometown to share his message. A whole crowd gathered to hear him speak. By the time he was done speaking, they were calling to have him killed. They even tried to take matters into their own hands and throw him off a cliff. If we read this story too quickly, we might miss the fact that the very people trying to kill him grew up with him. They would have been friends and neighbors that knew Jesus when he was a boy. And that’s not the only example of good relationships gone sour. One of Jesus’ closest friends gave him up to the authorities in exchange for money, and another denied ever knowing him while he was being arrested. His family doubted him, and his own mother likely felt the relational strains that came part and parcel of a full-time traveling ministry.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-935\" src=\"https://newstaging2stg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Quote-2-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" />The point is, Jesus’ relationships were far from perfect. Betrayal, doubt, insecurity, disagreement and distance muddied the waters even for Jesus. He couldn’t avoid relational stresses, but he did give us a model for how to respond to them and work toward restoration. His model? Radical patience and forgiveness.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-874\" src=\"https://newstaging2stg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RelationshipsHeadlines-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3750\" height=\"521\" />It might have been best illustrated in a story he told about a father and son. The son asked for his inheritance while the father was still alive—he valued the money more than the relationship. The father obliged, gave the money, and the son went off and spent it until he found himself completely destitute with nothing left. He resolved to return home to his father to humbly ask for a job—not to reclaim his spot as son, but as one of many hired hands. As he was walking up to the house, the father saw him from afar and ran out to embrace him. To forgive him. To welcome him home as a son.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-877\" src=\"https://newstaging2stg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RelationshipsQuote3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3750\" height=\"2443\" />Repairing broken relationships is incredibly difficult, and the forgiveness Jesus both talked about and displayed is often messy and complicated. But know if you feel the pang of hurt in your relationships, Jesus did too, and take encouragement in his resolve to repair what was broken.</p>\n<p>**If you are in an abusive relationship, please seek help. Jesus’ call to forgive should not be wrongly used to manipulate people into staying in abusive relationships. Seek out safety first.</p>\n",

                        "content": "<p>What if we told you that if Jesus had been born today, he would be from the sticks? The so-called boonies? A remote area that has a reputation of producing no one of prestige or education? The wrong side of the tracks? It may seem odd to think of Jesus this way, but it’s true. In Scripture, a conversation between two brothers, Phillip and Nathanial, provides context. One day Phillip met Jesus, heard his teachings, and felt his love. He was excited and went to share the good news with his brother, who replied, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?”</p>\n<p>At the time of his birth, Jesus’ family was forced to flee Nazareth for Egypt after King Herod decreed that all children under the age of two be killed. Yes, Jesus was a refugee, and the people of his hometown were not wealthy or elite by any means. No one expected anything positive or prominent to come from there, let alone someone who would change the world forever.</p>\n<p>Over two thousand years later, not much has changed. All we need do is turn on our televisions and observe how the media describes immigrants and refugees. They are often branded as invasive and disruptive, with their reasons for migrating and positive contributions muted. But why?</p>\n<p>The answer lies, in part, within the concept of unconscious bias &#8211; we may not know an individual, but because of where they are from, the color of their skin, or what they are wearing,  we make judgments about them.</p>\n<p>I was drawn to write this piece because I intimately understand the feeling of being dismissed because of where you come from. Unlike Jesus, I am not from the sticks, yet I, too, have judged because of where I came from. You see, back in middle school, I was the new black kid who moved from the looming city to the developing suburb. That gave the other kids a false narrative of how they thought I should be. Faster. Aggressive. Disruptive. Bold. In their minds, I wasn’t allowed to exist as I was because I looked a certain way and came from a side of town that mandated otherwise.</p>\n<p>Jesus too faced stereotypes based on society’s ideas about who he should be. That’s why his persecutors inscribed “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews” on the cross at his crucifixion. This was their attempt to mock him because how could a mere man from a small, forgettable town ever hold any power or authority? Perhaps others’ perception of him would have been different had he been born into a wealthy family in an area of prestige.</p>\n<p>Jesus made a point to reach out to those who were judged because of their birthplace or circumstance. He spoke to Samaritans, the ethnic enemies of the Jewish people. He went out of his way to uplift lepers, who had been outcast by their communities. He conversed with women, who had little to no political power or social authority. He did so out of love, but he was able to do it so well because he had experienced similar dismissal.</p>\n<p>Jesus provided an example of the powerful change that comes when we choose to overlook shallow demographics and focus our intent on truly understanding someone. How can we be more like Phillip, ignoring social hierarchy and judging not based on where someone comes from but solely on the content of their heart?</p>\n",

It is a powerful display of love for the one being forgiven, but that’s not all. It is also a release of resentment for the one doing the forgiving. The choice to forgive — though incredibly difficult at times — is a choice that stops the cycle of hurt and pain, turns the page, and brings with it real peace. It is a choice that is good for us.</p>\n<p>Even when rejecting hatred and resentment was hard, Jesus chose forgiveness. He offered that forgiveness freely, and his call is for us to do the same.</p>\n",
